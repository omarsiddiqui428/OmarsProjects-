1. Age and Sleep Program:  Asks the user their age and how many hours they sleep per day. 
From this information, the program outputs:
- the user's age in days, minutes, and seconds
- how many times the user has sneezed approximately in their life 
- the number of calories the user has expended in their life and how many bagels that is equivalent to
- the number of hours the user has slept in their life, and how many cumulative hours of sleep they are short of the recommened 8 hours per day

2. Array Program: Defines a macro arraySize of size n, creates two arrays of size n, passes these arrays to a function fillArrays that randomizes integers between 1-100 (inclusive) to fill both arrays.
Then the program prints both of these arrays and passes the filled arrays to a second function mergeArrays that creates a third array of size 2n.
The data from the first two arrays are stored in the third array, and then the sorted array is printed. 

3. Calculator Program:  performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divison with two inputted numbers. 
The user can choose which numbers to do these operations on, and which operation to perform. 

4. Computing Gas Volume: computes gas volume from user input of gass pressure, temperature, and moles

5. Dice Statistics: Prompts the user to input the number of times to roll a pair of dice. 
The program outputs statistics of the number of each dice sum (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) given that 
specified number of rolls. Then the program prints a histogram of the data. 

6. Pointer Program: Creates three pointers of size 0, one for integers, doubles, and characters.
The program prompts the user for which type of data they will enter (integer, double, character). 
It reallocates the amount of memory that pointer has and adds the new value to it.
Then the program prints all three pointers and loops until the user chooses to exit.

7. Vertical Number Program: prompts the user to input a number and prints the number vertically

8. Printing Shapes Program: prompts the user to input a letter and outputs a triangle, a square, and a diamond made out of that letter
